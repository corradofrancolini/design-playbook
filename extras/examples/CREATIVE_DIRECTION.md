## Starting constraints

- **Logo**: Existing wordmark — geometric sans-serif logotype, tracking +40. Not modifiable.
- **Palette**: Primary black `#1A1A1A`, warm white `#FAF8F5`, accent `#C4704B`. Auxiliary greys derived from black at 20%, 40%, 60%.
- **Target**: Professionals, high-budget clients, industry press
- **Positioning**: Contemporary, essential, curated. Perceived quality through space and detail, not through decoration.

## Visual mood

Full-bleed real photography — authentic situations, natural light, no compositing.
Generous white space: minimum margins 80px desktop, 24px mobile.
Strict 12-column grid with 24px gutter.
Subtle micro-animations: progressive fade-in (200ms ease-out), no bounce, no lateral slides.
Natural textures in backgrounds: paper, raw materials — never digital patterns.

## Design decisions

| # | Date | Decision | Context |
|---|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | 2026-01-15 | 3-color palette (black, warm white, accent) | Benchmark across 12 sites — reduced palettes communicate the essential positioning better. Discarded option with a second cool accent. |
| 2 | 2026-01-18 | 12-column grid, 24px gutter | Needed flexibility for asymmetric layouts in galleries. 8 columns too rigid for photo+text compositions. |
| 3 | 2026-02-01 | DM Serif Display + Inter | Geometric serif consistent with the wordmark. Inter for body readability. Discarded: Playfair (too editorial), Söhne (licensing). |
| 4 | 2026-02-10 | Real photos only, no stock | Own photo archive is the strength. Stock photos don't communicate authenticity. |
